<div class="textblock"><p><a class="anchor" id="acknowledgements"></a> Outcome has had an interesting history, and it is worth summarising it here to show how a Boost library comes to life. The git repo began life as a "Boost.Spinlock" in June 2014 hived out of Boost.AFIO v1 where it had existed for some time as an internal library. In October 2014 I added in the original prototype Boost.Expected reference library as a git submodule, and began developing a non-allocating <code>future&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code>promise&lt;T&gt;</code> as an extension of <code>expected&lt;T, std::exception_ptr&gt;</code> as a faster, monadic future-promise was something which AFIO v1 sorely needed.</p>
<p>The original prototype Boost.Expected library was a large and very complex beastie. I was fortunate to be employed on a contract in late 2014 early 2015 where I saw it deployed at scale into an existing large C++ codebase. Expected was really great and powerful, but it absolutely murdered compile times in a large C++ codebase, and made LTO effectively infeasible. I also found its implementation non-conducive to implementing future-promise with it, and so I resolved to implement a much more powerful policy driven monad factory which could stamp out everything from an <code>option&lt;T&gt;</code> right through to a future-promise pair, all using the exact same <code>basic_monad&lt;&gt;</code> and therefore all with a full monadic programming API, C++ 17 continuations/monadic bind and intelligently convertible into one another. Moreover, all this needed to have an absolute minimum impact on compile times and runtime overheads, neither of which were strengths of the original prototype Boost.Expected library.</p>
<p>By August 2015 "Boost.Monad" was delivering on all those requirements and then some, but it lacked maturity through use in other code. Summer 2015 saw the Boost peer review of AFIO v1 which was roundly rejected. After considering the ample review feedback, it was realised that AFIO v2 would be a very different design, one no longer using futures, memory allocation nor C++ exceptions. As AFIO v2 was started from scratch and using Outcome heavily from the very beginning (every AFIO v2 API returns a <code>result&lt;T&gt;</code>), Outcome began to gain bug fixes and shed features, with the non-allocating future-promise implementation being dropped in May 2016 and a large chunk of metaprogramming being replaced with cleaner variable templates in June. After CppCon 2016 in September, then began the long process of getting Outcome ready for Boost peer review in Q1 2017 which involved a repeated sequence of complete rewrites of the tutorial in response to multiple rounds of feedback from the C++ community, with at least four complete rewrites currently at the time of writing.</p>
<p>In parallel to all this development on Outcome, Expected went before the LEWG and entered the C++ standards track. As the WG21 meetings went by, Expected experienced a period of being stripped back and much of the complexity which had so murdered compile and link times in 2014/2015 fell away, thus the Expected proposed in P0323R1 ended up landing so close to Outcome that in January 2017 it was just a few hours work to implement Expected using the core <code>basic_monad</code> infrastructure in Outcome. That highly flexible policy based design which made monadic future-promise possible made it similarly easy to implement a highly conforming Expected, indeed in early 2017 Outcome's Expected was much closer to P0323R1 than any other implementation including the LEWG reference implementation. And unlike the LEWG reference implementation, Outcome has had eighteen months of that finely tuned patina you only get when a library is in use by other code bases.</p>
<p>In February 2017 it became realised that the userbase really wanted a high quality <code>expected&lt;T, E&gt;</code> implementation rather than anything similar but not the same which Outcome had invented. The only just implemented Expected implementation based on <code>basic_monad</code> therefore took primacy. The final rewrite of the documentation before peer review submission was one which made it look like Outcome was primarily an <code>expected&lt;T, E&gt;</code> implementation with a few useful extensions like <code>outcome&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>result&lt;T&gt;</code>. I was sad to so pivot, but it was obvious that Outcome would see far wider popularity and usage as primarily an Expected implementation.</p>
<p>It is heartening that the committee have concurrently made most of the changes to Expected that I also made in Outcome, as that suggests I am on the right track. Outcome's original very ambitious design may yet still contribute a lot of value simply through sheer flexibility and extensibility, yet with amazingly low runtime and compile time costs. I hope users of Outcome will agree.</p>
<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>To whomever it was who proposed the name "Outcome" for the library after a very extended period of name bikeshedding on boost-dev. I had been minded to call the library "Boost.Donkey" just to shut everyone up because the name bike shedding was getting ridiculous. But Outcome is a lot nicer, so thank you to whomever it was.</p>
<p>My thanks to those on boost-dev, Reddit and SG14 for extensive and often very detailed feedback on the library pretty much from its beginning. You are all too numerous to remember, but certainly Tongari and Andrzej Krzemienski come to mind as having engaged in particularly long discussion threads with tons of useful feedback which clarified my thinking. Andrzej also went through the documentation with a fine toothed comb before the review, finding many small errata and confusing wording.</p>
<p>Finally, my thanks to Vicente for driving Expected from its beginnings to hopefully standardisation before 2020. It's many years of work getting something standardised, even more years than getting a library into Boost which as you can see from the history above took about three years. </p>
